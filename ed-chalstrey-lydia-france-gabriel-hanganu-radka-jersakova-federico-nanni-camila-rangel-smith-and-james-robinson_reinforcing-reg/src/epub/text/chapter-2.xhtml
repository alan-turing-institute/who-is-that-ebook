				<p epub:type="title">The Brainstorm</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>The trio gathered around the whiteboard in Reginald’s cluttered office, a haven of creativity and chaos. Papers, diagrams, and sticky notes covered every surface, the result of countless hours of brainstorming and planning. Reginald, his scales shifting to a thoughtful green, picked up a marker and started sketching out their initial ideas.</p>
			<p>“We need a solid foundation,” Reginald began, his voice steady and sure. “The architecture has to support a sophisticated learning algorithm that can adapt and improve its cribbage strategy over time.”</p>
			<p>T-REG nodded, his massive head casting a shadow over the whiteboard. “Agreed. I’ll focus on developing the data models. We need something robust enough to handle complex pattern recognition.”</p>
			<p>Rusty, his eyes bright with enthusiasm, clacked his pincers in agreement. “And I’ll make sure our code is efficient and secure. No bugs will get past me.”</p>
			<p>As they worked, the room buzzed with energy. Ideas flew back and forth, each building on the last. Reginald’s sketches grew more detailed, transforming from rough outlines to intricate designs. T-REG’s data models took shape, a latticework of interconnecting nodes and algorithms. Rusty’s code began to flow, each line a testament to his meticulous attention to detail.</p>
			<p>“This is going to be amazing,” Reginald said, stepping back to admire their progress. “We’re really onto something here.”</p>
			<p>T-REG’s eyes gleamed with excitement. “Let’s keep this momentum going. We’re just getting started.”</p>
